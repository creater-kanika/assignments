Function: CGI is a standard for running external programs, often scripts (like Perl, Python), on the server to generate dynamic content for web pages.
Performance: Every CGI request spawns a new process to handle the request, which is resource-intensive and results in slower performance for handling multiple requests.
State Management: CGI does not have built-in session management, and it cannot maintain persistent connections between requests.
Java Servlets:

Function: Java Servlets are server-side Java programs that process client requests and generate dynamic web content. They run inside a servlet container (e.g., Tomcat).
Performance: Servlets are more efficient because they run in the web server's process. Instead of spawning new processes for each request, servlets handle multiple requests using threads.
Session Management: Servlets provide robust session management and can maintain state across requests through cookies, URL rewriting, and HttpSession.
Advantages of Servlets over CGI:

Performance: Servlets are more efficient as they are multi-threaded and execute in the same process, unlike CGI, which spawns a new process for each request.
Scalability: Servlets handle a higher number of requests simultaneously and scale better due to the use of threads.
State Management: Servlets have built-in support for session management, unlike CGI, which requires manual implementation of session tracking.
Practical Implementation
CGI Program (Python Example) to Handle a Form Submission:
python
Copy
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import cgi

# Set content type
print("Content-Type: text/html")
print()

# Get form data
form = cgi.FieldStorage()
name = form.getvalue("name")
email = form.getvalue("email")

# Display the form submission result
print(f"<html><body>")
print(f"<h1>Form Submission</h1>")
print(f"<p>Name: {name}</p>")
print(f"<p>Email: {email}</p>")
print(f"</body></html>")
This script handles form submissions and displays the submitted name and email.

Servlet Implementation to Handle the Same Form Submission:
Form HTML (index.html):

html
Copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Form Submission</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Submit Your Information</h1>
    <form action="submit" method="POST">
        Name: <input type="text" name="name"><br><br>
        Email: <input type="email" name="email"><br><br>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
Servlet Code (FormServlet.java):

java
Copy
import java.io.*;
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;

public class FormServlet extends HttpServlet {
    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        // Set the response content type
        response.setContentType("text/html");

        // Get request parameters (form data)
        String name = request.getParameter("name");
        String email = request.getParameter("email");

        // Get output stream for the response
        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();

        // Generate the response
        out.println("<html><body>");
        out.println("<h1>Form Submission</h1>");
        out.println("<p>Name: " + name + "</p>");
        out.println("<p>Email: " + email + "</p>");
        out.println("</body></html>");
    }
}
